Diwali in India is unlike any holiday or celebration in the western world. An entire country's population (Unlike Christmas in the States, *everyone* participates in Diwali.) lights up their houses inside and outside; some use little candles to create bright outlines around their homes. Everyone gives each other gifts; new clothes are worn; fantastic dinners are eaten.

And fireworks. Oh, the fireworks. They go all day - and all night. Don't even try sleeping. Just join your family on the rooftop and enjoy the show.
