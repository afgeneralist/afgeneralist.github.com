It is almost 3am and I've been working on my own creative video. This is the first time I have ever acted and or edited anything in my life. I am pretty sure the video my parents have of me walking out of scene picking my ass after doing the hammer dance doesn't count. 

In any case, the intension is to get as many people to see this as possible. If I can make enough *noise* on the internet, I have a good chance of winning something. I am being ambiguous on purpose. You'll know what I am talking about tomorrow when I post the video. Stay tuned.

I am thankful for iMovie...
