This past weekend Sarah and I went to Santa Pola to visit my abuelos. I have always enjoyed spending time with my abuelos from both sides of the family. As a small chap, they would always get my attention long enough for me to eat (as fast as possible) the wonderful food they served before I was back outside playing again. But as I got older, all the food I stuffed myself with no longer energized me, but left me sitting at the table longer in a comatose state. And as a result, I was around long enough to hear the stories they would tell us. 

Both sets of abuelos grew up during the Spanish Civil War. This means a normal day consisted of not eating, working before reaching puberty, all while Franco's regime decided to drop bombs on you. You can imagine their childhood, if you could call it that, is vastly different than any of ours. Listening to these stories help me understand better that the lecture we got when we left our bicycles outside, or be fed more food that is humanely possible, wasn't some trivial thing abuelos do when they have you over for the weekend. But rather it was a life lesson and a taste of history. 

I am thankful for my abuelos...
