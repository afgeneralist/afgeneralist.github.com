I don't know what the odds are that we get to be around on a day like 11.11.11, but it's obviously extremely low.  It makes me think about how humans are just a hiccup in time, and our lifetime even more insignificant.  But here we breathe on 11.11.11, despite the odds.  Let's make the most of our time.   

I am thankful for our time here together...
