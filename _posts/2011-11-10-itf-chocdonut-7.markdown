I have nothing profound to say. I am really tired and I just ate a chocolate covered donut. Not one that has a light layer of frosting on top but it was one of those fully covered pseudo-shelled chocolate donuts. Glory. I was going to take a picture of it but I finished it before I got to my camera.

I am thankful for the bakery that is 30 years from my door...
