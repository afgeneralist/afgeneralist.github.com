title: "The Art of Accountability: The Right Start Using Social Dynamics"

Within the past year I had this strong inclination to get into the habit of posting daily on twitter what I was thankful for. I got really excited about it and  actually looked into creating a twitter account and creating a website with a twitter feed to show all the activity generated from the ´I am thankful´ theme. But, similar to many of my other passing interests and ideas, I start off like a meteor bursting across the horizon but quickly burn out and the only remanence of the idea are scribbled notes in a spiral notebook, and a new folder of favorites in my browser. Ugh!!

I realize that my focus to get a twitter account and website to publicize the posts really distracted me from what my initial inclination was. Kinda silly when I think about it. As I mentioned above, I probably <strong>burn</strong> through an idea or potential hobby monthly and even in some cases weekly, I am sure, without ever having really giving it the effort I wanted to. For example, I've probably cycled through trying Photography 15 times and wanting to learn how to program a computer language another 20. It's caused quite a bit of frustration in life but recently I've really been making efforts to address the source of the issue by creating the right environment with respect to workflow habits, organization and accountability. That is what a big part of what this blog is about. I write to my friends, family and whoever else is listening about what I want to do and post my progress. And if there hasn't been an update on my blog about it, I invite them to, no, I <strong>expect</want> them to ask me what the deal is. It is actually really what I am trying to solve with, Groupject, the startup I am working on. 
	
Well, here I am challenging myself to do what I said I was going to do. For the next 30 days, starting tomorrow, I am going to post on twitter what I am thankful for. As I write this, I am inclined to even write daily on my blog expanding on my twitter post. Yes, that is what I will do. That is what I get for waiting so damn long to do this. 

I'd love if any of you want to join me on this. No matter if you can only commit to once a week, I think it would be great if you joined along. Either a post on twitter (but make sure you let me know) or send me an email.
