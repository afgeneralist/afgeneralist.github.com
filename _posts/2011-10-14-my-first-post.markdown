So here I am writing my first post on my site about my first article posted at EU-Startups.com. In September, I attended Startup Bootcamp Madrid Investor Day representing EU-Startups.com. It was pretty cool because I got a 'Press badge', which gave me early entry and I got to sit in Press specific seating. Quite official, I know. The event was good to attend for a number of reasons. Most importantly because it gave me an opportunity to get a pulse on what is happening here in Madrid and to meet some of the people that are making them happen. After all the presentations, the audience and teams moved to the lobby where ca√±as and tapas were served. All in all, the event was impressive and I'm glad I went.
