title: "I am thankful for Evernote"
---

If you have never heard of Evernote, I recommend you do some research to figure out how it can help you. It is a note-taking web application that works on both your phone and computer. It will actually sync across devices so your notes are always up to date. Recently, I have become a power user literally digitizing every thought, receipt and to-do in my life. The idea is to free my mind from the stuff that should be mechanical so I can focus my mental energy on things that require more brain power.

There is a little bit of a learning curve in how you might try to implement it into your life. Having a system helps a lot. If anyone has any questions and or need some suggestions please feel free to ask.
