I am thankful for dessert...

I know, who isn't, right? Today, Sarah and I went to Malisa√±a near Gran Via, which is right in the center of Madrid and hung out at a 50's themed cafe bar. We drank fresh mint tea and shared what I might claim to be the best carrot cake I have ever had. As the cake was served on our table you could see the moisture glisten under the light of our table lamp. Also, each time I cut a piece with my spoon I felt the cake resist, giving me the impression that my slightly dense treat was something real. Each mouthful agreed. Oh yea, it had a light layer of frosting with carmel drizzled around it. I think splitting it with Sarah was perfect. A whole piece might have been too much of a good thing. 

Thinking about it, I am not even sure the last time I had carrot cake.  


This blog post is part of a 30 day promise I made to myself that I shared with my family and friends. Go here to read the original <a href="/journal/2011/11/03/art-of-accountability.html">post</a>.
