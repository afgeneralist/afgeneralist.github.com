title: "Public speaking"

I enjoy good public speakers. I hope I become one. At Tetuan Valley presentation nights, I am having a really tough time when it comes to doing my pitch. I am comfortable with public speaking. However, there is something about a script that is really throwing me off. I speculate I am not preparing properly. I think I will do much better next week. 

I am thankful for people who speak well in public!?
