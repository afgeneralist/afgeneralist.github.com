title: "Are you paying attention?"
---

I am fascinated by how different people choose to communicate but more specifically the moment someone is motivated to communicate.  Pay attention because if you can catch this moment, consider this a gift. This is a glimpse, a truth in motion of who they are, where they come from, and what they believe in. 

I am thankful for communication...
