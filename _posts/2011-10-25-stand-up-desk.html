title: "Get up, or die! Why standing up will enable you to live longer!"
---

I once read something somewhere (really specific I know) that said one of western civilizations the worst inventions is the chair. Crazy, I know, but there is a lot of evidence to back this claim up. Trust me, Google told me. For example Google heard from USA Today, "Sitting is deadly". Hrmm, what else. Well, Mashable seemed to have more to say. They explain up until 100 years ago, most of our lives were lived on our feet. Physiologically we haven't evolved to sit for 10 hours a day, not without putting ourselves at risk. Sitting 6+ hours per day makes you up to 40% likelier to die within 15 years than someone else who sits less than three. Even if you exercise. We burn less fat when we fit down, impede blood flow etc., which have severe health consequences. 

The truth is I've been convinced that there are some major issues associated with sitting from my own experience, and I'm sure it doesn't differ from most people's. The ache's and pains in my neck and back are endless and I just want them to go away. I started researching 'stand up' desks a while ago, but at the time it seemed too much of a hassle. In any case, I'm back on that train and I've committed to orienting my work area as a stand up zone.
