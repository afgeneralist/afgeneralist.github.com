Sarah and I started watching Dexter on DVD this past year. Before starting a new season I always am apprehensive to start and postpone watching it about a week or so before Sarah gets to anxious to watch it. We finally started season six in typical fashion and, like always, am totally hooked after the first episode. This will be a good season.

I am thankful for Dexter...
