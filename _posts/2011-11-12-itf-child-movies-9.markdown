I watched a movie today that I watched as a kid with my brothers and dad, Rocketman. I remember how much we laughed. I think part of the fun of growing up is remembering how fun it was to be a kid. Anyhow, if you have not seen Rocketman you should check it out. 

I am thankful for childhood movies...
