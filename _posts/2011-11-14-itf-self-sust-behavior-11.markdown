When I think about it, I could probably eat one or two donuts daily and never really be effected by it. I'd probably get to work on time and get what I need done.  Except, I would never consider having a donut more than two days in a row without feeling really bad about what I might be doing to my body. 

However, I cannot say the same about sleep.  I'll go days at a time without sleeping well. Unlike eating one too many donuts, I, or anybody else for that matter, cannot go more than extended periods of time without sleeping well before it negatively affects everything I do.  Except, I seem to value the effect of having one too many donuts more than not sleeping well on a regular basis. I am pretty sure this isn't exclusive to me. This is especially relevant to me this past month since I haven't made a conscious effort to get a proper night's rest. Being busy isn't really an excuse all the time. Tonight I am going to bed before 10pm, not my usual 2-3am, and I will be having a <a href="journal/2011/11/10/itf-chocdonut-7.html">donut</a> tomorrow morning. Good night!

I am thankful for sleep...
