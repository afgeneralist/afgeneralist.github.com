title: "Am I really more productive?"
---

It's a huge pain in the ass when the internet does not <strong>work</strong> at my house. The internet has been down for the last day or so in my house and it's a huge pain in the ass. Some people might argue that they're more productive without it at home. Yea, but the time wasted going back and forth to the internet cafe for things I actually have to do is made up right there. 

I am thankful for working internet in my house...
