<p class="description">Web based start-up that offers financial tools through a platform that allows users to collaterize their social networks to secure interest-free loans, saving support groups, and flexible financing.</p>


<p>I was a Co-Founder and responsible for social media. The founder, Austin Hinkle, and I were accepted in the <i>Startup Riot</i> located in Atlanta, Georgia to pitch Savont to investors. <br />
	On behalf of Savont, I participated in the <i>University of California, San Diego Entrepreneur Challenge</i> that spanned six months of different activities.
