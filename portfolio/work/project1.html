<p>I led a team of 4 front-end developers to implement an attractive and usable interface. We were part of a large crew at AKQA (one of the leading digital design agencies in the world) that took Virtuwell from concept to creation. My responsibilities also included vetting of graphic designs and general design implementation strategies.</p>

<p>The website was built using the <strong>Groovy on Grails</strong> framework and utilized <strong>jQuery</strong> extensively.</p>
