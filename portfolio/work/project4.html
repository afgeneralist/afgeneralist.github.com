<p>I've been the webmaster for San Francisco Bay Area non-profit <abbr title="Satya Devi Memorial Trust">SDMT</abbr> for over a decade. As I've learned more about web development, I've improved upon the website - taking it from a strictly informational website in the 1990s to a completely online registration system today. Photo and video from SDMT's annual music contest are all online, and a data system is in place for tracking participants' achievements over the years.</p>

<p>The website uses <strong>WordPress</strong> for content management. I wrote a custom theme and registration system in <strong>PHP</strong>. A transition to a more efficient <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> system is underway.</p>
