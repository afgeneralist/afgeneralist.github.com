&lt;p&gt;Diwali in India is unlike any holiday or celebration in the western world. An entire country&amp;#8217;s population (Unlike Christmas in the States, &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; participates in Diwali.) lights up their houses inside and outside; some use little candles to create bright outlines around their homes. Everyone gives each other gifts; new clothes are worn; fantastic dinners are eaten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And fireworks. Oh, the fireworks. They go all day - and all night. Don&amp;#8217;t even try sleeping. Just join your family on the rooftop and enjoy the show.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content type="html">
				&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago, I published my &lt;a href='http://github.com/sumeetjain/jquery-markdown-footnotes'&gt;first open source project&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s tiny and useful only for a small group of people, but I made it myself and am proud of it - and I&amp;#8217;m certain it&amp;#8217;s the first of many. Anyways, today I saw that someone forked it on GitHub. I cannot hope to describe how exciting that is, but I&amp;#8217;ll try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of positive feedback do we usually get for our work? If (like me) your history is one of web development for corporations, praise comes in the form of kudos - usually from someone who hasn&amp;#8217;t worked with you (department head) or doesn&amp;#8217;t understand the work you do (manager or client)&lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best moments during a project at work are usually those spent in close collaboration with another developer. You&amp;#8217;ll bang your heads on the desk a few times, have an argument or six, and eventually figure out a solution. &lt;em&gt;This is how programmers bond.&lt;/em&gt; And the high-five shared after such an experience is more uplifting than any amount of kudos from a director, manager, or client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I saw that my tiny sliver of the open source pie was forked, I felt like I&amp;#8217;d just shared in one of those excellent post-discovery high-fives. But it was different in a couple ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one things, I don&amp;#8217;t know this person. It&amp;#8217;s a great feeling to have a stranger walk by your cyber-cubicle, glance at your screen, and say, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Hey - that looks pretty cool!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;#8217;s also different on a more fundamental level, since this isn&amp;#8217;t code that someone told me to write. This is just a solution to some problem I had. It&amp;#8217;s forking is an indication that at least one other person in the world appreciates the problem and is interested in the solution. It&amp;#8217;s a validation of my effort that - however minute - my work may have an impact on the Web at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there parallels to this kind of experience in other industries? Is there another field where collaboration is so immediate, streamlined, or essential? As I struggle to answer these questions, my joy at having become a coder is reinvigorated. I &lt;strong&gt;cannot wait&lt;/strong&gt; for my first pull request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients and managers have the best of intentions, but I have never met or worked with one who can appreciate the elation which results from victory after a day of delicate and creative problem solving. They appreciate results, but good developers love the experience of building, improving, dissecting, and learning about their work.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Example Multi-Category Post</title>

				&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s gift-buying time. And whether your process involves driving to a local retailer, browsing Amazon, or scouring Craigslist, you&amp;#8217;re likely to be inundated with so much choice that you&amp;#8217;ll spend most of your time researching to find the best products and deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is always a source of frustration for shoppers, because most of the time people just want a good value: Something with slightly above-average performance and a reasonable price. And even helpful reviews on Amazon or sites like CNET don&amp;#8217;t narrow the possibilities down to a manageable two or three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src='http://f.cl.ly/items/b0350b6b2dca2a1427d7/kallow.png' alt='Kallow' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caleb and Jordan at &lt;a href='http://www.kallow.com'&gt;Kallow&lt;/a&gt; have discovered what I think could be a useful idea - especially at this time of the year: They&amp;#8217;ve chosen 22 product categories (like &lt;em&gt;Digital Camera&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Headphones&lt;/em&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;Laptop&lt;/em&gt;), researched each - taking into account performance, ease of use, and price - and then listed &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; recommendation for each category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to them, if you&amp;#8217;re looking for a good deal on a digital camera, you can&amp;#8217;t go wrong with the &lt;a href='http://www.kallow.com/personal-electronics/digital-camera'&gt;Canon PowerShot SD790IS for $179.99&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s a good value, and for the vast majority of shoppers who don&amp;#8217;t care about 3x versus 4x optical zoom, 8 megapixel versus 10 megapixel, and Canon versus Panasonic, it&amp;#8217;s a done deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of Kallow is that it&amp;#8217;s either a conclusion or a beginning. That is, you might look at Kallow and immediately decide to buy the recommended product. So it&amp;#8217;s the conclusion of your shopping cycle. But some users can use Kallow as the beginning of their shopping cycle by following the product recommendation to Amazon, viewing similar products, and eventually choosing a competitor&amp;#8217;s product. The moral of the story is that you&amp;#8217;re more likely to find a quality deal by beginning your search with a good product than if you began your search from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m curious to see how the site develops after the holiday season. While cleanliness and simplicity are integral to the site, it goes without saying that more product categories are a must. But beyond that, I think adding a premium level to each category would draw in more of the power-user audience. Properly implemented, such a feature wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to detract from the site&amp;#8217;s ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to get prices from and link to Amazon is also something that I think will require revision. It&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for buyers to find better prices at smaller shops. If Kallow is really about recommending quality deals and saving consumers time, it should link to the best deal at a reliable online retailer. Of course, this flies in the face of Kallow&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href='http://sumeetjain.com/little-wisdoms/320/'&gt;business model&lt;/a&gt; (They make money by getting paid every time someone buys one of their recommended products on Amazon.), but I&amp;#8217;m sure Jordan and Caleb can think of some other way to stay in the black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href='http://www.kallow.com'&gt;Kallow&lt;/a&gt; for yourself, and let me know what you think. Were the recommendations helpful either as conclusions or beginnings? What product categories would you liked to have seen that weren&amp;#8217;t available? Did you tell anyone you know about Kallow?&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Leif Ericson Middle School doesn&amp;#8217;t educate students beyond the sixth grade. When I attended, the graduating class was to sing &lt;em&gt;I Believe I Can Fly&lt;/em&gt; by R. Kelly. The preparation for this event was a source of annoyance and embarrassment for the students participating, but that&amp;#8217;s not relevant right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, during rehearsal, a rare moment of revelry was permitted to continue beyond a few seconds. A friend - Alex Stollar - began singing a parody of R. Kelly&amp;#8217;s song. He was making it up on the spot, and the class was eating it up. Alex was very popular, but whether this contributed to his song&amp;#8217;s positive reception is not clear. Regardless, I was jealous of Alex&amp;#8217;s popularity, so I decided to one-up his song by singing my own immediately after he finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your reference, the actual lyrics of the song are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread my wings and fly away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a song-writer or a singer, but moments of desperation can bring out strengths we do not know we possess. I sang:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe I can &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; I believe I touch the &lt;em&gt;sun&lt;/em&gt; I think about it every night and day &lt;em&gt;Spread my legs and have some fun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re even a little bit shocked right now, you&amp;#8217;re far less sheltered than I was in the sixth grade. My brilliantly spontaneous song and plan had backfired. With the last line of the stanza, the class fell silent. All eyes turned in my direction. Our teacher Ms. Robertson, a tall blond woman with unnecessarily sharp features, stared at me with wide-open eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was paralyzed. I had expected - in order of preference - either glory, quiet chuckles, or quick dismissal. But this response was completely unforeseen! Whispers filled the room, some girls were snickering at me from the corner, not even my friends were laughing at my parody, and the stupid R. Kelly song was still playing on the stereo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frozen in time, I slowly evaluated the situation. Clearly, my song had some evil power of which I was unaware. No one was hitting me, I hadn&amp;#8217;t wet my pants or thrown up, and my grades were fine; so survival was not at risk. I decided there could be no harm in asking my teacher what I&amp;#8217;d said that was so egregious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned to Ms. Robertson, and - before I could open my mouth - she screamed at me in an awful, angry, male voice, &amp;#8220;What are you doing! What did you just say!&amp;#8221; I would have liked to answer, but her anger petrified me. She continued to berate me in front of the class. It seemed like hours, but I doubt the scolding lasted for even a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the class decided what was to be seen had been seen; so they returned to their work. Rehearsal was over the day. When I got home in the afternoon, I mentioned nothing of the crime I&amp;#8217;d committed. I just did my homework while trying to figure out exactly what I&amp;#8217;d done wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never told anyone the story, so I never found out what was so terrible about my parody. Obviously, as I grew older I learned how the song could be construed to have illicit meaning. Today, the memory is source of laughter for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do wish I could bottle up the feelings of confusion, shame, fear, and anger that I felt that day - and give the bottle to anyone who interacts with children. These were the feelings of an innocent boy who was beaten down for a misdeed he did not understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how many children are too scared to ask what they&amp;#8217;ve done wrong when they&amp;#8217;re scolded. Why are people so quick to make assumptions upon which negative conclusions depend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plea to educators, parents, siblings, friends, strangers: Always be listening. Always be teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
