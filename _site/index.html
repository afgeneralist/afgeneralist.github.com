	<h2 id="why_choose_me">Current Interests and Activities:</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.eu-startups.com"><strong>EU-Startups.com</strong></a> is a blog that covers internet and web 2.0 startup company's in Europe. I write part-time covering mostly the Spanish based company's and other start-up related topics. <br /> 
		<strong>Web behavior</strong> is my newest interest. I want understand how a user interacts with a website utilizing web metrics and then learn to influence them using the psychology based around user experience. <br />
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality"><strong>Enneagram of Personality</strong></a> is a typology of human personality. It is commonly promoted in both business and spiritual contexts. It is topic of study I have just begun to investigate.

			<h3>Some things I've done</h3>
			<p>In an effort to get you to know a little bit about myself, here are a list of things that I've done in the past (starting from most recent):
				<ul>
					<li>In August I moved to Spain with no job and only an intermediate level of Spanish. </li>
					<li>I was an intern at a small business/environmental consulting firm working on various projects related to cloud technology and education</li>
					<li>I hitch-hiked, ride-shared and couch-surfed around the U.S.A. for two months by myself.
					<li>Graduated with a degree in SocioCultural Anthropology from UCSD. </li>
					<li>During my attempt to play professional soccer in Europe, I decided to run with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain at the festival of San Fermin.</li>
					<li>I was part of an IT team of two at a publicly traded biotech company for four years.</li>
					<li>While playing soccer at Santa Clara University, which is located in the Silicon Valley, I studied Computer Science for a year and half. I've been a wannabe programmer ever since.</li>
				</ul>
				
				
			</p>

			<h3>Things I've learned to do well</h3>
			<p>A by-product of my university hopping, injury enduring, globe-trotting and geeky lifestyle, I've learned a few things along the way:
				<ul>
					<li>My travels domestic and abroad, my IT position within a bio-tech and academic focus have given me a diverse set of experiences that give me the tools to <strong>communicate effectively</strong> regardless of the context. </li>
					<li>After two major surgeries and years of rehabilitation I have learned that <strong>patience</strong> isn't just waiting a long time, it is being apart of the process for better or for worse. </li>
					<li><strong>Perseverance and dedication</strong> trumps all. Despite being told I'd never play soccer again by my doctor and several physical therapists, I elected for a rare pubic bone surgery that could potentially help me become active again. After years of rehab and one more surgery, I finally attained what I sought out to four years before. I played one full season of college soccer before I dropped out of University and quit my job because I had a professional trial in Portugal.</li>
				  <li>I learned to be <strong>comfortable with the uncomfortable</strong>. I took risks, especially when it came to the things I needed to do regardless of how I might fail. Moving to Spain, hitch-hiking and couch-surfing, quitting University and my job to try and play professional soccer and electing for a pubic bone surgery that may not have healed have been the toughest but the most important decisions in my life.
					
				</ul>
