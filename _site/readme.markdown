# Your Jekyll & GitHub Pages Blog
This is a basic website shell using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) (blog engine) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) (hosting). It is a stripped down version of [my website](http://sumeetjain.com). (You don't really need to use GitHub Pages to host this - it should work equally well on any server that has Jekyll installed.)

I'm a freelance web developer, so my website is structured for my expected audience - namely potential clients. The homepage is a summary of my skills and work experience. I also keep a journal for friends and family (and strangers) on the website. And I sometimes write more technical articles, so there's a category for those too.

Here's what the website looks like:
